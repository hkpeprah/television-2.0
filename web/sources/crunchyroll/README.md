Crunchyroll
===========
This API is a stripped down version of [aheadly](https://github.com/aheadley)'s python crunchyroll project
https://github.com/aheadley/python-crunchyroll.  In particular, it reduces the complexity and limits us
to only the methods needed for the work being down here.

## Areas of Concern
Currently we are unable to get video durations from the API.
