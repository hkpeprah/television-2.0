Telebble
===============
This is a rewrite of my Television application to be better extensible, use better backends, and
overall be better written than its predecessor.

## Web Documentation
Documentation for the web implementation is available [here](web/README.md).

## Pebble App Documentation
Documentation for the Pebble application implementation is available [here](pebble/README.md).

## Contributing
See the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) document for information about contributing and current contributors.

## License
For licensing information, see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE.md) document.  In general, I don't care if
you take the code, modify it and use it personally as long as you link back to the original project.
However, if you intend to release your modifications as an application on the Pebble appstore,
please contact me beforehand.
